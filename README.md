## What Problem We Solve ⚠️
•	Many students and staff feel unsafe when walking alone, especially at night. <br> <br>
•	Sometimes they want a companion, sometimes they just need someone checking on them.<br> <br>
•	And in a real emergency, they need to quickly send their exact location to trusted people.<br> <br>
•	On top of that, stress and fear can get overwhelming — so we provide an AI companion to keep users calm, cared for, or entertained.<br>

### First of all, feel free to dive in and [check out our video presentation📹](https://youtu.be/QZbEvUgRgYA), [flip through the presentation slides📑](https://github.com/TOH1004/CodeNection_Ruff/blob/main/Pelajar-pelajar_Slide.pdf), and [play around with our UI framework in Figma📱](https://www.figma.com/design/Is7K2aTnqgapnNkhJ9JZ81/CodeNection?node-id=0-1&t=QfTOygHvVbg7UGej-1) . 
### Next, let me walk you through the details of this project.<br><br>

## Here’s what our app can do ✅

### 1. Onboarding & Journey Start 🛣️ 
When users land on our homepage, they will see a **“Start Now”** button. By tapping it, they can choose their destination to begin their journey. At the same time, a **video-call room** will be created to provide real-time accompaniment. <br>


### 2. Post Status for Acompanian 👫 <br>
Users can **create a status** whenever they want a companion to walk home with them.
They can also control who is able to view the post, and the system will only display their **coarse location** for privacy.
Other users can then browse the in "status" to see these posts in real time. <br>
Users also have the option to share their location with friends through external apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram. <br>

### 3. AI Companion 🤖 <br>
If user still alone, they can choose to be accompanied by our AI Buddy. <br>
Our AI Buddy comes with useful skills such as calming scripts, campus safety tips, and helpful reminders which offers **three** supportive modes.  <br>
In **Silent Mode 🎵**, the AI **stays mostly quiet**, giving short affirmations and playing soothing background music.  <br>
In **Chatty Mode 💬**, it engages with **cheerful conversation**, fun facts, and friendly banter to keep the user company.  <br>
In **Caring Mode 🤗**, the AI provides **gentle reassurance**, emotional support, and calming tips to help users feel safe and at ease. <br>
The AI companion also acts as a long-term companion, staying with users by recognizing **safe words** in their speech. These **safe words** are set by the users to ensure their safety, and users can choose whether to enable this feature.


### 4. SOS Button 🚨 <br>
SOS button will be triggered in condition below: <br>
i) User **presses the big red SOS button**. <br>
ii) User's **connection lost for more than 30 seconds**. <br> 
iii) User not **tap their screen within 1.5 minutes**. The 1-minute countdown is displayed and counted by tapping anywhere in screen. <br>
The next 30 seconds are used to check on user's condition.<br>

#### After SOS button triggered: 
**Nearby operating stores and the guardhouse location** will be displayed. 
Guardians and campus security are immediately **notified with the live location and route details**, allowing them to respond quickly and effectively. <br>

#### User can choose to:
i) **Wait for guard** - The feature is designed for users with injuries or limited mobility. When a guard receives the SOS notification, they will come to assist the user. <br>
ii) **Go to the nearest shop** - Designed for situations where the user feels they are being followed. The app provides a safe route to an open shop. <br> 

**If the user still feels unsafe upon arrival, guards can proceed to their location.<br>
After resolution, the app offers to (a) post a “safe now” status or (b) continue the journey.** 


## Conclusion 🏁
Ruff is more than just a campus safety app — it is a trusted companion that combines blockchain security, AI-driven emotional support, and real-time emergency response into one platform. By empowering students to stay connected with friends, guardians, and security personnel, Ruff creates a safer and more supportive campus environment.<br><br>

Team Pelajar-Pelajar built this project with the vision of giving every student peace of mind, whether they are walking home with a friend, accompanied by our AI Buddy, or relying on the SOS system in times of need. With Ruff, no one has to feel alone when it matters most.<br>
